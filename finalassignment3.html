      <h2>What They Do</h2>
      
      <p>Paleontologists, as most people know, study fossils, their formation, and how long
      they've been there. What most people do not know is that Paleontology is much more
      than just fossils. The subdivisions include micropaleontology, paleobotany, palynology,
       invertebrate paleontology, vertebrate paleontology, paleoanthropology, taphonomy,
       ichnology, and paleoecology.</p>

      <h2>Career Skills</h2>
      
      <p>To become a paleontologist, one must take geology classes. Chemistry, physics, calculus,
      statistics, and computer science are very important classes to take as well. </p>
